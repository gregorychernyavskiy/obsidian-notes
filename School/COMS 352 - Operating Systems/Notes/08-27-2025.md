The cycle of the Scheduler with Blocked State:

	I/O initiate    I/O done
Running (P4) --> Blocked --> Ready (P2, P1, P3) --
^                                                                     |

When the process (P) is waiting it is placed in the blocked state, if the process is ready it is following first in first out. Only one process can be running at a time.
