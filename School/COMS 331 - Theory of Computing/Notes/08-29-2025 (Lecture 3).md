Bijection:
Def: If S and T are two sets |S| $\subseteq$ |T| if there is a one-to-one function f: S -> T
Def: |S| = |T| if there is a bijection f: S -> T 


Suppose |S| $\subseteq$ |T| and |T| $\subseteq$ |S| => |S| = |T| ??

f: S -> T which is one-to-one
g: T -> S which is one-to-one
So, is there a bijection h: S -> T

**Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder Theorem:**  
If there exists an **injective (one-to-one)** function
f:A→Bf: A \to Bf:A→B
and an **injective (one-to-one)** function
g:B→A,g: B \to A,g:B→A,
then there exists a **bijection** between AAA and BBB.  
That is, ∣A∣=∣B∣|A| = |B|∣A∣=∣B∣.

N = { 0, 1, 2 ...}
R: positive real numbers
Chain:
|N| $\subseteq$ |R|
but |R| is not  $\subseteq$ |N|, so |N| $\subset$ |R|, proof with Diagonalization 


Pigeon Hole:
Two sets S and T: |S| > |T|. Say f: S -> T
there exists two elements x $\neq$ y $\in$ S such that f(x) = f(y).


Suppose we have a graph G = (V, E) |V| = n.
step 1: short at a vertex v.
step2: pick an outgoing edge and go there, or stay there.
WALKING on the graph.
Suppose we walk for n + 1 steps, we must revisit a vertex. 
f: {1 ... n+1} -> V
f(i) = vertex you are at time i.


 Say S is a set of integers, |S| = 100
claim:
	there exists two elements  x $\neq$ y $\in$ S such that (x - y) is divisible by 71.
proof: use pigeon-hole principle
S = {X1, X2, ... Xn+1}
There are 71 possibilities that can take a value between 0 and 70.
By pigeonhole principle $\exists$ i $\neq$ j such that xi = xj.
 xi = xj
xi % 71 = xj % 71
xj % 71 = xj => xj = 71x
