What is theory of Computation?
1. Understand the notion/concept of computation.
2. Laws that govern computation.

Programs solve "Computational Problems".
Are there Computational problems for which we can not write programs??

Programs can get stuck in infinite loops.


		DOES NOT EXIST
Program --> Meta Program     --> It never gets into an infinite loop.
                         --> There is an input on which it goes into an infinite loop.
This "Meta Program" does not exist!!!

**EXAMPLE #1:**
*Theorem:*
- There are infinitely many prime numbers. 
*Proof:*
- Every integer can be written as a product of primes.
- Every integer is divisible by a prime number.
*Proof by Contradiction*
- Assume there are finitely many primes.
- There are only **k** Primes (k is an unknown integer).
- There are only k-primes. Let's call them *P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>3</sub> … P<sub>k</sub>*
- N = *P<sub>1</sub> × P<sub>2</sub> × P<sub>3</sub> … × P<sub>k</sub>* + 1 (N is an integer).
- N must be divisible by *P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>3</sub> … or P<sub>k</sub>
- Is N divisible by P<sub>1</sub> ?? -- NO. P<sub>2</sub>?? -- NO.
- N is not divisible by P<sub>1</sub> or P<sub>2</sub> ... or P<sub>k</sub>.
- N is not divisible by any of P<sub>1</sub> ... P<sub>k</sub>.
- So N is a Prime AND P<sub>1</sub> is some other prime divides N.
- SO CONTRADICTION, there are infinitely many prime numbers.

**Theorem.** There are infinitely many primes.
**Proof.** Suppose $p_1,\dots,p_k$ are all the primes. Let
$$N = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k + 1.$$
For each $i$, $N \equiv 1 \pmod{p_i}$, so no $p_i$ divides $N$.
Hence $N$ is prime or has a prime divisor not among $p_1,\dots,p_k$,
a contradiction. $\square$
