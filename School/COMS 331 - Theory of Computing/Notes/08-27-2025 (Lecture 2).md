***Sets:***
- Set belongs to some universe (U --> any numbers, integers or Natural numbers {0, 1, 2 ...} (Depending on the context)).
S, T, A, B
- In this course U --> Set of binary strings = $\sum_{i=0}^{n} i$
- Union, Intersection, Cross-product



***Contradiction:
S.T = {a b | $a \in s$, $b \in T$}
S = {00, 11}
T = {010, 110}
S.T = {00010, 00110, 11010, 11110}

***Cardinality  of Set S:***
Number of Elements: |S|
***S*** is Finite or Infinite

$\forall$ is for all
$\exists$ there exists

$\forall x$
$\exists |s|$

|S| = |T|
|S| < |T|
|S| > |T|

S and T are infinite
Let's say S is even positive integers.
And let's say T is all natural numbers.

S is {0 2 4 ...}
T is {0 1 2 3 ...}

Set: is the collection of the items/objects 
B: place x in B if and only if $x \notin x$
Does $B \in B$?
