## Repetition Over Time

What I **should have done** for each topic:
- watch a couple of hours of videos on the topic, to get the main idea
- implement the algorithms and data structures
- make flash cards for important things I should remember about the topic
- **move on to the next topic**
- review the flash cards when you have time
- after a few days, watch another video about the topic, perhaps 30 mins or so
- after another week, watch a video about the topic, maybe same video or shorter one
- keep reviewing flash cards
